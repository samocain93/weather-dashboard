## Description

A simple application that utilizes third party API's to retrieve both current weather data and a 5 day forecast for searched cities.

The application functions to take in a search input for a city, render both the current weather info in a display box, as well as a 5 day forecast for the given city containing the same weather data. The page will save the user's searched history into local storage and retrieve it to display the 5 most recent searched cities. Upon rendering the search history to the page, the user will be able to click the previously searched cities and have the information repopulate to the page to view the weather.
